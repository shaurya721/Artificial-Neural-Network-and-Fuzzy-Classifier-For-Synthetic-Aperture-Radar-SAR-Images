# Artificial-Neural-Network-and-Fuzzy-Classifier-For-Synthetic-Aperture-Radar-SAR-Images
Enhanced SAR image classification using ANN and fuzzy classifier, achieving up to 90% accuracy. Applied Lee filtering, Pauli decomposition, and k-means clustering for feature extraction and visualization.

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging has become an
essential tool in remote sensing applications due to its ability
to provide high-resolution images regardless of weather
conditions or daylight. SAR systems transmit radar signals and
receive the reflected signals from the Earth's surface, which
are then processed to form images. SAR images often suffer
from noise and speckle due to the complex interaction of radar
waves with the terrain, which can degrade the quality of the
images and make interpretation challenging.
Advanced image processing techniques and classification
algorithms are required to tackle these challenges. This study
employs Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Fuzzy
Classifiers for SAR image analysis. ANNs are computational
models inspired by the human brain's neural networks, capable
of learning complex patterns and relationships from data.
Conversely, fuzzy classifiers handle uncertainty and
ambiguity in data by using fuzzy logic, enabling a more
flexible and robust classification process. The primary goal of
this research is to develop a robust and efficient system for
SAR image classification using ANNs and Fuzzy Classifiers.
This approach aims to improve the accuracy and reliability of
SAR image interpretation, essential for various applications
such as environmental monitoring, disaster management, and
land cover classification.


  The workflow of the proposed system incorporates several key
  steps:
1. Data Acquisition and Preprocessing: SAR images are
obtained for different polarizations (HH, HV, VH, VV) and
pre-processed to remove noise and enhance the quality of the
images. The Lee filter is employed for denoising SAR images
by adaptively estimating noise variance within local regions,
enhancing image quality, and preserving features crucial for
subsequent classification tasks.

2. Pauli Decomposition: The pre-processed SAR images
undergo Pauli decomposition to extract the three basic
scattering mechanisms. This decomposition provides a basis
for feature extraction and helps in understanding the physical
properties of the imaged terrain.

3. Feature Extraction: Texture features are derived from the
pre-processed SAR images, capturing important
characteristics of the terrain and aiding in distinguishing
between various land cover types.

4. Classification using ANN: The extracted features are
utilized to train an ANN classifier, which learns to classify the
SAR images into various groups like urban areas, vegetation,
and water bodies. The ANN classifier is trained using labelled
training samples, and its performance is evaluated using test
samples.

5. Fuzzy Classification: To further refine the classification
results and handle uncertainties in the data, a Fuzzy Classifier
is applied to the result of the ANN classifier. The Fuzzy
Classifier uses fuzzy logic to assign class labels to the SAR
images based on their feature vectors, resulting in more precise
and reliable classification outcomes.

6. Visualization and Evaluation: The classified images are
visualized using colour maps to differentiate among various
land cover types. Confusion matrices are also created to assess
the effectiveness of the classifiers.

7. Cluster Analysis: Additionally, a k-means clustering
algorithm is applied to the extracted features to identify
distinct clusters corresponding to different land cover types.
This provides insights into the data distribution and assists in
validating the classification results.


This research presents a comprehensive approach to
classifying SAR images using sophisticated machine learning
techniques, specifically ANNs and Fuzzy Classifiers. The
proposed system aims to overcome the challenges linked with
SAR image analysis by enhancing the accuracy, reliability,
and interpretability of the classification results.
By integrating feature extraction, ANN-based classification,
fuzzy logic, and cluster analysis, the developed system offers
a robust framework for SAR image interpretation, with
potential applications across different fields such as
environmental monitoring, disaster management, and remote
sensing. The following sections will explore the
implementation details, results, and discussions of the
proposed approach.
